This program coregisters a pair of images in sub-pixel precision.

It runs on both python 3.5 and 3.6 (64bit). The source code is debugged only on python 3.5.

The code is originally developed for sub-pixel coregistration process in:
1) Interferometric SAR program
2) Image stacking program for hunting space debris and small NEOs in multiple nightsky images
